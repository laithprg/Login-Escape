# Login-Escape
Hello, I am a beginner programmer. I created this simple page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to log in with an email and password. After entering the correct credentials, "Click Here" appears, but it moves away from the mouse, making it unclickable. Feel free to modify or learn from this page. I appreciate your support! ❤️
