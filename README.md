# My Login Page Project

Hello! I am a beginner programmer, and I created this simple page using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This page allows you to log in using your email and password.

## Features:
- Login using email and password.
- You can modify the password and email as the owner.
- When the correct email and password are entered, a "Click Here" message appears that continuously moves away from the mouse, making it difficult to click.
- **You can modify or develop the page as you like**, including changing the email and password or adding new features.
- **You can learn how to create a login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** from this project.

## How to use:
1. Enter the email and password.
2. A welcome page will appear if the credentials are correct.
3. Try clicking on the link that moves away from the mouse.

## Project Support:
I hope you can support me, even if it's just a small amount, so I can continue my journey in programming. Thank you so much ❤️
